2.Difference between window,screen and Document?

Window 

window is the main JavaScript object root, aka the global object in a browser, and it can also be treated 
as the root of the document 
object model. You can access it as window.

Screen

Screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions . It can be used to display screen width, height, 
colorDepth, pixelDepth etc. I
t is not mandatory to write window prefix with screen object. It can be written without window prefix.

Document

The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's 
content, which is the DOM tree. When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser , it becomes a document object. It is the root 
node of the HTML document. The document actually gets loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, 
URL, cookie, etc. HTML documents, served with the "text/html" content type, also implement the HTMLDocument interface, whereas XML and 
SVG documents implement the XMLDocument interface.
